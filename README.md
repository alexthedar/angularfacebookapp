##Angular Facebook App##

This app will tie into facebook through facebook's api allowing the user to login, logout, and post to their feed.  This will also pull in the allowed user information.

Used [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as basis and [ng-facebook](https://github.com/GoDisco/ngFacebook) for facebook integration.
